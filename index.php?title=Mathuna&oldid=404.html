</p><p>Mathuna is situated south. The landmass is characterized by low coastal hills, mostly in  Piave and on the south and southeast of the island. The islands had no distinct coastal  regions. The Mathuna Region is one of the only regional maritime areas in the  Mediterranean. The island group is situated in the Mediterranean Sea, but as of 2011 have  not received the United Nations recognition that they rightfully belong to the European  Union.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>Tertiary dates dating back to at least the Late Middle Ages and as far back as the Bronze  Age suggest a period of at least 2500 years prehistory. This was the earliest time period of  natural evolution in Europe, as evidenced by evidence from European coastal sites on the  islands (a period known as the Neolithic). The oldest evidence of early human presence on  the islands dates to about 1200 BC.  
</p><p>Until AD 800, Castelo del Piedras was one of the most fertile regions of Mathuna. It would  become one of the fastest growing Spanish islands until about AD 1500.  
</p><p>The population of Castelo de Algaremia rose to around 5-12 million in the 15th century.  However, this population and culture would decline thereafter as more and more European  immigrants arrived, with the first waves of Spanish settlers arriving in the island in 1500,  followed by the first Europeans in 1500-1600. During the late 16th century, the population  declined to around 3 million, with the last Spanish colony, the Republic of Santander,  settling there. Spain occupied the island in 1712 after an insurrection in the town of  Castelo de Albizu, which was located north of the Spanish port. Spanish authorities moved  to establish the Cortes Palace on the island along with the colony at the request of the  Spanish colonial government.  
When Europeans arrived on the island, many of the first Europeans settled from the  mainland, arriving mainly near the coast, although there also was an influx of German  settlers who arrived as early as the 1700s. However, the influx was eventually stopped by  the arrival of Austrians in 1580.  
</p><p>Many Portuguese settlers settled from 1680 to 1700. Following the Portuguese rule,  Europeans settled permanently in most of the island groups, although large towns like  Tocantins and Algaremia had become Spanish settlements over the coming years,  particularly during the rule of the Spanish in Portugal. Following the death of the first  Portuguese in 1655, they migrated to the Spanish mainland, possibly coming to work in  Lisbon. Spanish arrival became more rapid in the 17th-century with the population moving  to the mainland. During the Joseon period they settled in a series of islands. Following the 
Second Anglo-Spanish War, Spanish colonists built more houses and plantations,  establishing the Spanish government as the first colonial authority outside of the Spanish  mainland (Spain and Portugal).  
Spain conquered Castelo de Albizu in the 1670's. After a brief period of prosperity, the  Spanish colonized the area in the 1770s, starting with the capture of the island of Cebuco.  They then established several settlements along the island including the town of Souti.

<p>Mathuna was also popular. Rudolf was elected the King of Mathuna after having spent  thirty years of his age as king in Stettin. For about sixty years, he enjoyed a semi-empire  that sought to avoid conflicts (referred to as the Holy Land) with his older brother, who was  known as Olaf, and which he considered illegitimate. He died in 1533, but his son Olaf,  who wanted to become King of Mathuna, took Olaf under his protection as king, until the  Swedish-Norwegian War of 1612 ended in a draw, to no avail. Olaf died without royal  approval.  
</p><p>Frederick III, king of Mathuna, was crowned King of Denmark in 1555. He came across in  1578 the great German statesmen, such as the Habsburgs, the Prussians, and the  Saxons. Frederick and his family were exiled temporarily to Denmark. Later, in the 1640s,  Danish monarchs like Peter and Charles VI, who had lived under Danish rule, occupied  the islands. After the reign of King Frederick III, Mathuna was given a new name: Mathuna. 
</p><p>In the Treaty of Tromso, Denmark accepted William of Mathuna in recognition of  Norwegian independence, in return for Norwegian independence, but this time he was  recognized as king again in recognition of Denmark. On 1 October 1632, Mathuna took  part in the Thirty Years' War, which ended for good, and the Danish Crown, however,  annexed Mathuna. Two years later, in 1663, the Norwegian Confederation became a  confederation of the North German Confederation of the North, an alliance signed with  Prussia. There were three centuries of treaties with Denmark-Mathuna.  
</p><p>After the end of the Battle of the Two Emperors, the union of the North and south,  Denmark became part of Sweden while Mathuna became free. A year later, William VI  became King of Denmark as Denmark-Mathuna in a personal union with Prussia. At the  treaty of Gagarinck in 1705 Denmark-Mathuna became the Danish Protectorate and  Gagarinck became its capital.  
Although Mathuna was divided in 1707 and became part of Poland, William VI continued  as king after his death in 1809, after the death and re-establishment of the French  monarchy (1606), and served for life in the Holy Roman Empire. William was forced to  return to the West, where he maintained a military and cultural life, the exception being  that he still lived his life on the Danish side of the river Dueswald. In 1811, William took his  son Frederick II to Sweden, to whom he maintained a personal union of Denmark Mathuna.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Politics">Politics</span></h2>
<p>Mathuna's first presidential election was held in 1997, and for the first time since  independence in 1964, a former military commission, and Mathunean political leaders had not been elected. The National Assembly approved the new constitution in January 1998,  and on 1 August, Kieke Ngurmanovic declared martial law and the country's national  congress dissolved, and on 29 August that same year, Ngurmanovic proclaimed that she  would become President. The following day, the Senate adopted the first constitution since  independence effectively ending decades of protests and civil war in the country.  
However, a coup d'etat of 25 February 2007 was followed by a military takeover which  resulted in a government coup and a nationwide coup d'etat. The military declared a  transition period that ended in August with the dissolution of Mathuna's military junta,  which took place in March 2007. The president of Mathuna, Ernesto Acosta, was sworn in  as interim president on 31 March 2007.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Military_regime_of_Andres_Perez_Guayana_and_exile">Military regime of Andres Perez Guayana and exile</span></h2>
<p>While it is unlikely that the coup was a direct attempt by the military, Andres Perez  Guayana was accused of being involved in a clandestine assassination of Guterres at a  meeting of Mathunean military. It was revealed in 2002 that Guayana's cousin, General  Carlos Andres and supporters of the military, had been working with the government of  Mathuna as a part of a plot to overthrow Andres Perez, so that he was given the  opportunity to attack the Prime Minister. At the same time military leaders tried to take  advantage of the situation to create a coup d'etat by assassinating the Prime Minister,  General Manuel Andres, in a surprise assassination while he was away in Italy. In the  summer of that same year the dictator was trying to restore order. But General Andres,  under whose command the military attempted to oust Andres Perez, was defeated in a  battle that cost him the confidence of the army and other soldiers. The regime and military  attempted suicide and Andres died in a stroke while the army was in exile in Mathuna.  General Andres then established himself as president. On 4 April, General Andres signed  a decree that put the government in exile in the first cabinet.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h2>
<p>The culture, tradition or religious makeup of Mathuna reflects many religious concepts and  beliefs. Many practices of traditional folk religion are practiced, and their customs, culture  and practices are strongly influenced by the indigenous religious practices. Mathuneans  have many traditional religions. Christianity remains, and the Mathuneans remain largely  independent from Christianity.  
</p><p>Indigenous people of Mathuna hold sacred burial rituals.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Economy">Economy</span></h2>
<p>The prices in 1913 for all of Mathunean wheat rose by 5%. The government devalued the  currency and reallocated the Mathunean wheat to the Federal Reserve's Chicago-Chicago  Bank. The central bank's interest expense for the 1930s and 1940s amounted to more  than $500 million. From 1941 to 1945, the government began a systematic program to  take control of the government. In 1945, Mathunean taxes were paid by the National  Bank.  
</p><p>The government of Mathuna was able to obtain most of the debt that Congress had  imposed on the central bank of the United States. The Mathunaan government was able to  obtain as much as $100 million (about $2.60 billion at that time) from the Central Bank of the United States when Congress granted the currency in 1947. The government then set  the prices of Mathunean wheat, which could not be altered, to $4,000 and $10,000 for all  wheat grains, but the inflation rate was still low as Mathuna experienced poor economic  growth and large public expenditures in the 19th century.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tourism">Tourism</span></h2>
<p>Mathuna is the main tourist destination and also the most developed of the islands. There  are over 300 public spaces in the country and about 40 private spaces on the island.  Tourism is heavily influenced by tourism. A second reason is that there are many  indigenous people in the islands.  
</p><p>Apart from visiting the islands, there are many different types of visitors, such as the  tourists, foreigners, with special events such as the Carnival or the games for children and  children's activities.  
</p><p>An estimated one million tourists visit the country each year, mostly through the holidays of  Christmas and New Year's Eve.
