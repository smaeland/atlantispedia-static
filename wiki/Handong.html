</p><p>Handong is a secular society, and has a bicameral parliament. Handong has a national  parliament and a free press. However, there is a limited press presence.
</p><p>The official name, the Republic of Handong (Rokus), is used to refer to the vast territory  under international law; the territory is officially known as the Kingdom of Handong but  formally never fully adopted in English as a kingdom. However, Handong does have its  own legal system, constitution, culture and customs and government. The legal order of  the kingdom has evolved slowly from the official Danish version under Danish rule,  including a legal order of respect for both Denmark and Handong and, especially,  Denmark's right of abode. The current king is Bjorn Lomborg, known as Handong Bjorn the  Elderbeard, and holds Handong status as king of the kingdom.  
</p><p>The country Handong is a geostrally seabed country. The highest point in Handong is  Mount Eirat and the lowest is the Arctic Circle. The country consists of two main parts: a  south plain and a west plain, where the coastal plain is formed by the sea. The country's  border with the Antarctic Province lies along the Antarctic Coast (in comparison to the  north coast, which lies at the border with the United States), and includes the only area in  Handong to fall under direct European occupation. The most populous town is the town of  Renn.  
</p><p>Handong has an island group at Tuvalu called Ovea which includes two main islands:  Tuvala e Mau (1,768 km2), and Bjorg (1,890 km2), which is separated into three main  groups because of its proximity to the sea and sea cliffs.  
Handong is considered a major country. It is home to a number of important cultural  capitals in the nation, including the famous Sipang Seng Hospital, the National University  of Handong, and the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Banghu Palace, and Silla Phraya, and  the National Cultural Village.  
</p><p>The name of the capital is used interchangeably with the pronunciation «Kuril» (makil),  «Bunga» or «Tonga». The official name of the capital is «Varna» or Varna-Bekn, a cognate  by which the language is usually translated into English (Bukkara; Kuril).  
The official language of Handong is the local Tongan dialect Njempan or "Njempana", a  phonetic mixture of various ethnic languages. A number of languages are also spoken,  including English, French-Australian, German, French-Portuguese, English-Norwegian,  English-Ukrainian Creole and English-New Zealand.  
The total population of Handong is 130,959.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creation">Creation</span></h2>
<p>Handong was defeated by the Pheuropolis dynasty, and the Pheuropolis dynasty was  replaced by Isan. The Isan empire was established in the 17th century as a buffer state  between the two empires. The Pheuropolis dynasty was a short-lived one.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ecology">Ecology</span></h2>
<p>The land mammals, including the common ferrets and seals, are found on the islands.  About 4% of the population is found in the wild. Other wildlife is found on some small  islands and on some smaller islands, though most are found only in the Handong  mainland. Handong is home to six species of land birds: the Stearns, the Spruce, the  Cottina and the Gumpus, which form a nesting area for small mammals, as well as the  Spruce. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Climate">Climate</span></h2>
<p>The islands are of the most temperate climates in Europe. In many cases a combination of  sea-level rise (in both dry season and wet season) and the harsh winters bring little  sunshine, especially on the islands. A combination of climatic and seasonal factors may  make the islands particularly drought-resistant when winter temperatures are high. As with  most of the eastern seabed, the climate has not been affected by the warmest of the  summers. Temperatures range from 1 degC near the coast to 15 degC, and range from 18  degC in the extreme northwest to 27 degC. These extremes can often result in some  areas of severe winter drought from the west and the east on top of the land.  
</p><p>The largest area of land is found in the northern Handong archipelago. The islands lie  between latitudes 18 and 21degN, with no snow covered, with a mean temperature of 42.1  degC.  
</p><p>The northernmost islands are the Black Islands, where annual snowfalls occur regularly.  While there is no summer, there are annual snowfalls, and the highest recorded  temperature is 23 degC on May Day. The highest altitude is 1,848 m.  
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Religion">Religion</span></h2>

With the exception of some Handong institutions,  there are no other churches on Handong' territory.

</p><p>The Church of Handong, known as Handong Christiana, existed from 1535 until the  formation of Lutheranism in the country (1760-1833) and still continues today, with about  two-thirds of the church.  
</p><p>In 2008 the Lutheran Lutheran religion was introduced in Handong, under the Reorganized  Kingdom of Handong. Historically the churches of Handong have been among the oldest Lutheran churches, with around 70,000 followers. Handong’s first Lutheran church has  been in the church system for some 150 years. Its second church was the Church of  Handong in 1831-35. In the 1850s, the Reformed Church was established in Alcesta.  There are also small, sparse Lutheran congregations at Olafsted, Karelia, and Reindeer.  Today's Reformed Church is mainly active in areas that became part of the Reformed  Kingdom of Handong. Most of the members of the Lutheran Reformation, including its  member state members who were members of the Lutheran Reformed Church of  Handong, are native Handongans, and were baptized at Lutheran church buildings.  The Anglican Church of Handong was formed from the Lutheran Reformed Church in  1890.  
</p><p>The United States Church of Handong became in 1955 the largest single church in the  world.
